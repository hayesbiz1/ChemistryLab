# ChemistryLab
Interactive environment for learning chemistry. Built using Unity and C#. Unity 2022.3.5f1

Planned features:

Add/remove protons, neutrons, and electrons to create specific atom "types" (elements), ions, and isotopes.

Once an atom has been created, add the atom to the elements library (essentially, the periodic table).
Alternatively, an atom can be instantiated by selecting the desired element in the periodic table and clicking "Create"

Atoms are bound together to form molecules. Molecules can be saved to the "Molecules" library.

Examine and manipulate atoms and molecules in either 3D or 2D.
