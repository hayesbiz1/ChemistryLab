# ChemistryLab
Interactive environment for learning chemistry. Built using Unity and C#.

Planned features:

Users start by adding protons, neutrons, and electrons to create specific atom "types" (elements).
Atoms can be added to the elements library (essentially, the periodic table).
Atoms in the library can be combined to form molecules.

Users can examine the atoms and molecules they've built in either 3D or 2D.
